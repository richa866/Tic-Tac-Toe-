# Tic-Tac-Toe-
This project is a digital version of the timeless two-player game Tic-Tac-Toe. The objective is simple: get three marks in a row, column, or diagonal to win!

Here's a quick breakdown of what makes this classic game a little more exciting:

-> Hover Effect: A ðŸ’š border appears when hovering over each cell, offering a visual cue for the next move.

->Distinct Borders for X and O: X ( ðŸ§¡ ) and O (ðŸ©· )are assigned unique border colors, creating a clear visual distinction between players.

->Winning Pattern Highlight: When a player wins, the winning combination is highlighted in ðŸ’› , drawing attention to the victory pattern.

->Reset Button with Alternating Start: The reset feature not only refreshes the game but alternates the starting player for fairness.

->End-of-Game Modal: A modal appears at the end of each game to declare the outcomeâ€”whether itâ€™s a win or a drawâ€”and offers options to either reset or stop the game.
